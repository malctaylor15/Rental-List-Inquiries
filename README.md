## Malcolm R Project 

There are several files associated with the Malcolm R Project. It is still a work in progress but below is a short description of the files. 


In Dataframe_Cleaning1.R- 
We add a few features for the time and date information as well as change several data types for later analysis. 

In Data_Cleaning2.R- 
we do some analysis on some of the features to remove outliers that could skew our results. 
We have some quick histograms to illustrate several features of the data 

In Sampling3.R- 
We remove the outliers as mentioned in Data_Cleaning2.R 
We sample from the data to create a modeling sample that has more evenly balanced dataset. 
These datasets are ready for analysis.
